# NCF-Turtle-VR

This is a project I am currently working on with Dr. Tania Roy at New College of Florida. The goal of the project is to create a educational, interactable simulation of marine pollution in VR. This simulation would be used to teach middle school aged children the basics of how pollution harms marine life.


Current Status of Project
-----
After working from late June through July, the project is on hiatus until the Fall semester (late August). Currently, the project is not in VR or interactable (aside from basic movement), although it could be made playable with an Occulus Rift given 15 minutes and Oculus' toolkit for Unity.

In its current state, the project is a proof of concept that needs more optimization, interactivity, and gamification.


(Concrete) TODO
----
* Reduce polygons on coral and combine meshes for clusters of coral
